title: 6.4. Initial Climbs 
---
The initial climb refers to the altitude or flight level assigned to the pilot during the flight clearance for ascending after takeoff. 

While certain airports explicitly display the initial climb information on the **SID (Standard Instrument Departure)** charts, others may not include it. 

In the case of **Bahrain International and Kuwait International**, the initial climb is indicated as 4000ft in the highlighted red box below.
