# Pilot Briefing

## Chapter 1: Initial Contact 
As the pilot of your aircraft it is your responsibility to ensure you have listened to the **A-ATIS (Automatic Terminal Information Service)** so you know the active runways, current weather and any other operational information at the airfield. 

When either the En-Route Controller or Approach Controller asks you to contact them you should do so immediately. 
On initial contact with the controller you should provide the following information: 

- Callsign 
- Aircraft Type 
- Current Flight Level or Altitude 
- Current ATIS Letter you're in receipt of

Example:

> **Pilot:** _**"Bahrain Radar, GFA520 with you F260, Airbus A320, Information C"**_ 

Once you have made initial contact the controller will identify you on radar and proceed to give you instructions for how you should arrive into Bahrain.

## Chapter 2: Assigned Standard Terminal Arrival Route & Approach 
After you make initial contact with the controller they will provide you with a **Standard Terminal Arrival Route (STAR)**, an approach aid that you will use for landing at Kuwait and in some cases an altitude to descend too. 

Example: 

> **Controller:** _**"GFA520, Identified, ORDIG1 Arrival, expect ILS Approach Runway 30R, descend Flight Level 160."**_ 

You must read back this clearance in full as it contains very important information. 
You must cross-check your charts, ensure the arrival assigned is in your navigation database, if it is not you must inform the controller immediately. 

You must adhere to any flight level, altitude or speed restrictions annotated on the relevant arrival chart unless advised otherwise by the controller. 

## Chapter 3: Cleared for the Approach 

Once the controller has descended you to start your final approach you will be cleared for the approach type you were issued. 

Example: 

> **Controller:** _**"GFA520, turn right heading 270 degrees, cleared ILS Approach RWY30R, report established"**_ 

Again, you must read this back correctly and fully. 

It is a standard rule of thumb within Bahrain, you should be 180kts at 10DME, 160kts at 4dme to ensure safe and efficient operations. 
Once you are established you will advise the controller. 

> **Pilot:** _**"Bahrain Approach, GFA520, fully established ILS Runway 30R"**_ 

The Approach Controller will then hand you over to the Tower Controller. 

## Chapter 4: Landing Clearance 
On initial contact with the Tower Controller you should provide the following. 

Example: 

> **Pilot:** _**"Bahrain Tower, GFA520, fully established ILS30R 7DME"**_ 

The Tower Controller will either advise you to continue approach or clear you to land. 

## Chapter 5: After Landing
Upon arrival in Bahrain you should aim to vacate by one of the following points:

| **Runway** | **Exit Points** |
|:----------:|:---------------:|
|     30R    |   A4 or before  |
|     12L    |   A7 or before  |

Once you have done so the Tower Controller will provide you with an initial taxi instruction to get you away from the holding point efficiently and hand you over to the Ground Controller who will provide you with further taxi instructions to your Stand. 

Example: 

> **Controller:** _**"GFA520, Welcome to Bahrain, taxi via Q, Z, Stand 11."**_ 

Again, please ensure you have the charts available and read back the instructions correctly. 
You will then taxi to stand and no further communications need to be made.
