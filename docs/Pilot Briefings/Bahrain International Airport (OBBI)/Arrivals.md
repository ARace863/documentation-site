# Departing Aircraft 

## Chapter 1: Requesting Clearance 

Prior to contacting Bahrain Delivery (DEL) the pilot should have listened to the **D-ATIS (Automatic Terminal Information Service)** to obtain the latest and up to date current weather conditions at **Bahrain International Airport (OBBI)** along with any additional airfield operational information such as runway information, closures etc. 

On first contact with Bahrain Delivery you as the pilot should report the following information: 

- Callsign 
- Aircraft Type
- Stand Number 
- Current ATIS Information Letter
- Current QNH 

Example: 

> **Pilot:** _**"Bahrain Delivery, GFA101, Airbus A320, Stand 22, Information D On-board, QNH 1002, requesting IFR Clearance to Dubai"**_ 

The controller will then proceed to give you a clearance which must be read back in **full** and **correctly**. 

Example: 

> **Controller:** _**"JZR741, Good Afternoon, cleared to Dubai via N697 SODAK, after departure fly heading 345 degrees, climb initially altitude 4000ft, Squawk 4414"**_

As there are no **Standard Instrument Departures (SIDs)** all aircraft are cleared via the airway to a point and issued a heading to fly after departure. 
This is must be flown correctly to avoid aircraft turning towards the BHR VOR which will enter aircraft into restricted airspace. 

You can see the initial headings issued in Bahrain based on direction of flight below. 

| **Runway** | **TMA Exit Point** | **Initial Heading** |
|:----------:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
|     30R    |        NARMI       |         300         |
|     30R    |        TULUB       |         345         |
|     30R    |        SODAK       |         345         |
|     30R    |        ASTAD       |         345         |
|     30R    |        LOTOR       |         345         |

| **Runway** | **TMA Exit Point** | **Initial Heading** |
|:----------:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
|     12L    |        TULUB       |         120         |
|     12L    |        NARMI       |         075         |
|     12L    |        SODAK       |         075         |
|     12L    |        ASTAD       |         075         |
|     12L    |        LOTOR       |         075         |

Various flights also have flight level caps which you can find below:

| **Destination** | **Max Altitude / Flight Level** |
|:---------------:|:-------------------------------:|
|       OT**      |             11000ft             |
|       OM**      |              FL250              |
|       OKKK      |              FL260              |
|       OEDF      |              6000ft             |

## Chapter 2: Requesting Pushback & Start + Taxi 

Pilots are expected to have reviewed their Airport Ground Movement Charts to have a good understand of their potential taxi routing. 
When you are ready for push back and start this should be requested with the delivery controller or the next relevant controller. 

Example: 

> **Pilot:** _**"Bahrain Delivery, GFA101, request push and start Stand 22"** 

If delivery is online they will then hand you over to the Ground Controller or next relevant controller who will either delay your pushback or give you a clearance to pushback in a specific direction. 

> **Controller:** _**"GFA101, push back and start is approved facing East on Zulu"**_ 

Prior to commencing your pushback you should again review the charts and ensure you are pushing back as assigned by the controller in the correct direction. 
Once your pushback is complete you can then request taxi clearance, again it is your responsibility to review the airport ground movement chart to ensure you have a general idea of your potential taxi routing and any taxiways and holding points along the way. 

Example: 

> **Pilot:** _**"Bahrain Ground, GFA101, request taxi"**_ 

> **Controller:** _**"GFA101, taxi to holding point A9 RWY30R via Z, S and A."**_

Upon reaching the holding point if you are not ready for an immediate departure you shall inform the controller as quickly as possible. 

## Chapter 3: Takeoff 

When handed off to the Tower Controller you will be expected to be ready for departure upon reaching the runway holding point. 
You must have cross checked your aircraft systems to ensure you have the correct departure setup. 

It is good airmanship to ensure you have the next controllers frequency set in the standby frequency in your VHF system. 

Example: 

> **Controller:** _**"GFA101, after departure fly heading 345 degrees, surface wind 330 at 10kts, runway 30R, cleared for takeoff"**_ 

> **Pilot:** _**"Cleared for take off runway 30R, after departure fly heading 345 degrees, GFA101"**_ 

Once you're airbourne the Tower Controller will then hand you over to Approach or the next relevant controller, you must read back the full and correct frequency. 

## Chapter 4: Climb Out 

Once you have been handed off to the Approach Controller on initial contact you advise the following information:

- Callsign 
- Passing Altitude 
- Assigned Heading 

The Approach Controller will then identify you on radar and clear you further.

# Arriving Aircraft 

## Chapter 1: Initial Contact 
As the pilot of your aircraft it is your responsibility to ensure you have listened to the **A-ATIS (Automatic Terminal Information Service)** so you know the active runways, current weather and any other operational information at the airfeild. 

When either the En-Route Controller or Approach Controller asks you to contact them you should do so immediately. 
On initial contact with the controller you should provide the following information: 

- Callsign 
- Aircraft Type 
- Current Flight Level or Altitude 
- Current ATIS Letter you're in reciept of

Example:

> **Pilot:** _**"Bahrain Center, GFA520 with you Fl260, Airbus A320, Information C"**_ 

Once you have made initial contact the controller will identify you on radar and proceed to give you instructions for how you should arrive into Bahrain.

## Chapter 2: Assigned Standard Terminal Arrival Route & Approach 
After you make initial contact with the controller they will provide you with a **Standard Terminal Arrival Route (STAR)**, an approach aid that you will use for landing at Kuwait and in some cases an altitude to descend too. 

Example: 

> **Controller:** _**"GFA520, Identified, ORDIG1 Arrival, expect ILS Approach Runway 30R, descend Flight Level 160."**_ 

You must read back this clearance in full as it contains very important information. 
You must cross check your charts, ensure the arrival assigned is in your navigation data base, if it is not you must inform the controller immediately. 

You must adhere to any flight level, altitude or speed restrictions annotated on the relevant arrival chart unless advised otherwise by the controller. 

## Chapter 3: Cleared for the Approach 

Once the controler has descended you to start your final approach you will be cleared for the approach type you were issued. 

Example: 

> **Controller:** _**"GFA520, turn right heading 270 degrees, cleared the ILS Approach RWY30R, report established"**_ 

Again, you must read this back correctly and fully. 

It is a standard rule of thumb within Bahrain, you should be 180kts at 10DME, 160kts at 4dme to ensure safe and efficent operations. 
Once you are established you will advise the controller. 

> **Pilot:** _**"Bahrain Approach, GFA520, fully established ILS Runway 30R"**_ 

The Approach Controller will then hand you over to the Tower Controller. 

## Chapter 4: Landing Clearance 
On initial contact with the Tower Controller you should provide the following. 

Example: 

> **Pilot:** _**"Bahrain Tower, GFA520, fully established ILS30R 7DME"**_ 

The Tower Controller will either advise you to continue approach or clear you to land. 

## Chapter 5: After Landing
Upon arrival in Bahrain you should aim to vacate by one of the following points:

| **Runway** | **Exit Points** |
|:----------:|:---------------:|
|     30R    |   A4 or before  |
|     12L    |   A7 or before  |

Once you have done so the Tower Controller will provide you with an initial taxi instruction to get you away from the holding point efficently and hand you over to the Ground Controller who will provide you with further taxi instructions to your Stand. 

Example: 

> **Controller:** _**"GFA520, Welcome to Bahrain, taxi via Q, Z, Stand 11."**_ 

Again, please ensure you have the charts available and read back the instructions correctly. 
You will then taxi to stand and no further communications need to be made.

# VFR Aircraft 

VFR Flights are approved at Bahrain providing the ceiling is greater than han 1500ft or the ground visibility is greater than 5KM. 

## Chapter 1: VFR Circuits 

Please see below the VFR Circuit Directions for Bahrain (OBBI)

| **Runway Configuration** | **Direction** | **Altitude** |
|:------------------------:|:-------------:|:------------:|

## Chapter 2:  Visual Reporting Points (VRPs)
**Visual Reporting Points (VRPs)** are specific geographical locations used in aviation to assist pilots in navigation and communication with air traffic control. These points help pilots maintain situational awareness and provide reference points for reporting their position during flight. 

Bahrain has a number of **Visual Reporting Points (VRPs)** which you can see below. 

| **Identifier** |  **Name**  | **Radial & DME from BHR VOR/DME** |     **Coordinates**    |
|:--------------:|:----------:|:---------------------------------:|:----------------------:|
|       N1       | November 1 |         020 Degrees / 6nm         | 262059.85N  504157.35E |
|       N2       | November 2 |         350 Degrees / 2nm         |  261729.13N 503902.73E |
|        E       |    Echo    |         160 Degrees / 6nm         |  260945.38N 504116.75E |
|       S1       |  Sierra 1  |         230 Degrees / 4nm         |  261304.73N 503546.62E |
|       S2       |  Sierra 2  |        270 Degrees / 1.5nm        |  261533.39N 503738.75E |
|        W       |   Whiskey  |        270 Degrees / 7.5nm        |  261553.19N 503059.68E |

## Chapter 3: VFR Phraseology 

VFR Departure Phraseology 

> **Pilot:** _"Bahrain Tower, A9C-ZZ with you holding point A8, runway 30R"_

> **TWR:** _"A9C-ZZ, via A8, cleared for takeoff runway 30R, winds calm, report overhead Whiskey VRP"_

> **Pilot:** _"Bahrain Tower, via A8 cleared for takeoff runway 30R, will report ovehead Whiskey VRP"_

> **Pilot:** _"Bahrain Tower, A9C-ZZ overhead Whiskey VRP"_ 

> **TWR:** _"A-ZZ, roger, contact Bahrain Approach 127.850"_ 

!!!node "Callsign Shortening"
    With VFR Traffic you are allowed to abbreviate the callsign once contact has been established. Your first transmission with the aircraft must always include their full callsign however, from then on, you may abbreviate the callsign to 3 letters, this helps reduce frequency congestion.

VFR Zone Entry Phraseology 

> **Pilot:** _"Bahrain Tower, A9C-ZZ with you 5nm North West of the Whiskey VRP, Altitude 1500ft, request clearance into the Control Zone for Full Stop Landing"_

> **TWR:** _"A9C-ZZ, Good Afternoon, cleared to enter the Control Zone, not above altitude 1500ft via Whiskey VRP, VFR, QNH 1001, Squawk 7001"_

> **Pilot:** _"Cleared to enter the Control Zone not above altitude 1500ft via Whiskey VRP, QNH 1001, Squawk 7001"_ 

> **TWR:** _"A-ZZ, Readback Correct, report overhead the airfield"_

!!!node "Controller Preference"
    The Controller can elect where to have the inbound VFR traffic head to after they have recieved their initial zone entry clearance depending on traffic levels.

VFR Circuits

> **Pilot:** _"Bahrain Tower, A9C-ZZ, with you holding point A8, ready for departure"_
