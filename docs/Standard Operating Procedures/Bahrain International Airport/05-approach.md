!!!node "Covering"
    This section details all the necessary and required Standard Operating Procedures for **Approach** Operations at **Bahrain International Airport (OBBI)**

# 1. General Provisions

**Bahrain Approach (APP)** is responsible for providing surveillance based seperation services for arriving and departing aircraft within the Bahrain **Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA)**. The APP Controller is also responsible for ensuring safe and efficent flow of arriving, departing and transiting aircraft within it's airspace.

# 2. Airspace 
The **Bahrain Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA)** is an airspace with split classifications that reaches a maximum of FL170, its lateral boundaries include the Kingdom of Bahrain and the surrounding waters and borders. 

The airspace is in the **Bahrain Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA)** doesn't allow for alot of maneuverability due to it's geographical location and multiple surrounding country borders so aircraft need to be carefully managed in order to ensure safe seperation between arrivals and departures. 

|     **Airspace Type**     | **Airspace** | **Class** | **Vertical Limits** | **Controller** |
|:-------------------------:|:------------:|:---------:|:-------------------:|:--------------:|
| Terminal Maneuvering Area |  Bahrain TMA |     D     |   1000ft - 4500ft   |    OBBI_APP    |
| Terminal Maneuvering Area |  Bahrain TMA |     C     |    4500ft - FL150   |    OBBI_APP    |
| Terminal Maneuvering Area |  Bahrain TMA |     A     |    FL150 - FL170    |    OBBI_APP    |

## 2.1 Transition Altitude and Level
The transition altitude and level in Bahrain is consistent with the Gulf Region. 

| **Transition Altitude** | **Transition Level** |
|:-----------------------:|:--------------------:|
|         13000ft         |         FL150        |

The transition layer exists between these two altitudes and is not to be used by controllers or aircraft alike for level flight.

## 2.2 Aerodromes Covered
The APP Controller is responsbile for **Bahrain International Airport (OBBI)**, **Isa Airbase (OBBS)** and **Sakhir Airbase (OBKH)**

Both Isa and Sakhir Airbase are military airfields to which we do not provide ATC services for on the ground. 

## 2.3 Surrounding Airspace 
The **Bahrain Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA)** is surrounded by both Saudi Arabia to the West and Qatar to the South. As APP Controller in Bahrain you have to work closely with the adjacent controlling units to ensure safe and efficent operations within the TMA.
