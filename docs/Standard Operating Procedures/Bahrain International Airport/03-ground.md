!!!node "Covering"
    This section details all the necessary and required Standard Operating Procedures for **Ground** Operations at **Bahrain International Airport (OBBI)**

# 1. General Provisions
Bahrain Ground is responsible for managing aircraft movements on the ground within the airports operational area, excluding runways. The Ground (SMC) controller provides pushback and taxi instructions for departing aircraft to their assigned runway holding point, while arriving aircraft are given taxi instructions from the arrival runway to their designated stand. 

----------

# 2. Designated Areas of Responsibility
**Bahrain International Airport (OBBI)** feautures one primary Ground Movement Control Position (SMC). It's primary role is to ensure safe movement and efficent movement of aircraft on the ground.

----------

# 3. Procedures 
The below procedures are in place to ensure SMC controllers are all trained to a sufficent standard and to ensure consistent operations between controllers and to pilots operating in and out of Bahrain International Airport. 

## 3.1 Push-Back Procedures
Aircraft will be transferred from the DLV controller once they have succesfully recieved a clearance and have informed DLV they are ready for pushback. Upon initial contact with the SMC controller pilots should be fully ready for pushback, providing they have reacher their Target Off-Block Time (TOBT) if applicable. Providing there are no obstructions, they will be instructed to push back immediately. 

However, if an aircraft requesting pushback has not correctly set the assigned transponder code, they **must** be instructed to squawk their assigned code prior to pushback clearance being issued by the SMC controller. 
Bahrain Ground is responsible for issuing all pushback clearances at Bahrain International Airport irrespective of which apron they are parked on. 

Pushback direction is typically given based on the active runway in use and aircraft location in reference to the departure runway.

### 3.1.2 Push-Back Types

#### 3.1.2.1 Standard Pushback 
This is the common standard push-back type which will typically have aircraft stop abeam the adjacent stand to which they were parked.

#### 3.1.2.2 Short Push-Back
A short push-back instruction shall require the aircraft to complete the pushback abeam to the current stand such that the adjacent stand will not be blocked.

#### 3.1.2.3 Long Push-Back
A long push-back instruction shall require aircraft to complete the pushback operation more than two stands away from where the pushback originated from. This manoeuvre may be used when an aircraft is vacating a stand to be used by another aircraft that is taxiing in after landing.

#### 3.1.2.4 Conditional Push-Back
Conditional Push-back instructions are given to aircraft awaiting pushback but are required to wait for aircraft passing behind them or pushing on an adjacent stand to them and one of the procedures listed above are not available to use. 

## 3.2 Push-Back Phraseology

### 3.2.1 Standard Push-Back Phraseology
The standard pushback phraseology issued to pilots by the SMC controller is:
> **Pilot:** _GFA003, Stand 19, B789, requesting push and start_

> **SMC:** _GFA003, Stand 19, push and start is approved facing West on taxiway Z, QNH 1003_

> **Pilot:** _Push and start approved facing West on taxiway Z, QNH 1003, GFA003_

!!!node "Hectopascal"
    When the QNH falls below 1000HPa it is required for all controllers to verbalise the QNH as follows: "QNH 993 Hectopascal"

### 3.2.2 Short Push-Back Phraseology

In the event you need to issue an aircraft with a short pushback instruction in order to keep an entry or exit to the apron clear for inbound or outbound traffic or to ensure a stand remains clear you can issue the following:

>  **Pilot:**  _GFA003, Stand 19, B789, requesting push and start_

>  **SMC:**  _GFA003, Push and start approved facing West on taxiway Z, finish abeam Stand 18, QNH 1003_

>  **Pilot:**  _Push and start approved facing West on taxiway Z, finish abeam Stand 18, QNH 1003, GFA003_


### 3.2.3 Long Push-back Phraseology

In the event you need to issue an aircraft with a long pushback instruction in order to keep an entry or exit to the apron clear for inbound or outbound traffic or to ensure a stand remains clear you can issue the following:

>  **Pilot:**  _GFA003, Stand 19, B789, requesting push and start_

>  **SMC:**  _GFA003, Push and start approved facing West on taxiway Z, finish abeam Stand 21, QNH 1003_

>  **Pilot:**  _Push and start approved facing West on taxiway Z, finish abeam Stand 21, QNH 1003, GFA003_

### 3.2.4 Conditional Push-Back Phraseology

In certain scenarios you may be required to issue a conditional pushback clearance, such as when you have an arriving aircraft taxiing behind an aircraft ready for pushback on stand. By providing conditional clearances we can continue to operate a safe and efficent operation. This ultimately prevents a build up in delays on the ground and reduces time on the radio.

>  **Pilot:**  _GFA003, Stand 19, B789, requesting push and start_

>  **SMC:**  _GFA003, behind the Emirates B777 passing from your right to left, push and start is approved facing West on taxiway Z, behind, QNH 1003_

>  **Pilot:**  _Behind the Emirates B777 passing from right to left, push and start is approved facing West on taxiway Z, QNH 1003, GFA003_

!!!node "Important Reminder"
    When providing a conditional clearance you should provide the pilot with the name of "airline" and not the callsign of the specific aircraft

    In addition to this, if the aircraft passing behind belongs to the same airline, it is common practice to specify the traffic they are waiting for by saying "Behind the company B787"

### 3.2.5 Simulataneous Pushback Operations 
Simulataneous Pushback Operations may be permitted from adjacent stands provided aircraft are instructed to maneuver in accordance with Section 3.1.2. The aim is to ensure that once both aircraft have completed their pushback procedures, they will be position on the taxiway with at least one stand between them to allow for ground crew clearance and aircraft maneveuring. 

## 3.3 Departure Taxi Procedures
Once aircraft have completed pushback operations it is the additional responsibility of the SMC Controller to ensure aircraft are taxiied efficently and safely to the departure runway. Tranfer of control to the TWR Controller should be made early enough such that the aircraft is not required to stop it's taxi. 

### 3.3.1 RWY30R Departure Configuration
Aircraft will be taxiied out from their respective apron at the most convenient point to ensure efficent operations onto taxiway 'A' to depart full length from holding point A9 for RWY30R. If requested by the pilot and traffic permitting intersection departures can be offered to reduce taxi times.

> **Pilot:** _Bahrain Ground, QTR1003, request taxi_

> **SMC:** _QTR1003, taxi holding point A9, RWY30R via Z, T and A_

!!!node "Being Helpful"

    If the pilot requires a bit of assistance maneuvering around the airfield you can provide them with progressive instructions or assist them with turn directions. 

### 3.3.2 RWY12L Departure Configuration
Aircraft will be taxiied out from their respective apron onto taxiway 'A' to depart full length from holding point A1 for RWY12L. If requested by the pilot and traffic permitting intersection departures can be offered to reduce taxi times.

#### 3.3.2.1 RWY12L Departure Taxi Phraseology

> **Pilot:** _Bahrain Ground, QTR1003, request taxi_

> **SMC:** _QTR1003,taxi holding point A1, RWY12L, via Z, T and A_

!!!node "Fun Fact"
    Taxiway 'A' is the disused RWY12R/30L and is still a functional runway with working equipment. However, this runway is no longer used and is used strictly as a backup runway.

### 3.3.3 Intersection Departures
Intersection Departures can be utilised when the pilot requests it specifically. The SMC Controller is not allowed to to instruct an intersection departure to a pilot without it being requested. 

| **Runway** | **Intersection** |
|:----------:|:----------------:|
|     30R    |        A8        |
|     12L    |        A2        |


### 3.3.4 Northside Aprons
Aircraft parked on either the Northern Apron or the Texel Apron on the North Side of the Airport will be expected to be taxiied to B1 or B2 respectively, then transferred to the TWR controller for runway crossing. 
Once they have succesfully been taxiied from the North Sie to the South Side and crossed the active runway they will be handed back to the SMC Controller to be taxiied to the active runway for departure.

> **SMC:** _CNV1222, taxi to holding point B2 RWY30R via B, QNH 1013_

> **Pilot:** _Taxi to holding point B2 RWY30R via B, QNH 1013, CNV1222_

> **Pilot:** _Bahrain Ground, CNV1222, holding short RWY30R at B2_

> **SMC:** _CNV1222, Hold Short RWY30R B2, Contact Bahrain Tower 118.500 for crossing_

!!!node "Confirm!"

    You must ensure you **adivse the aircraft to hold short** of the active runway prior to transferring them to TWR for crossing. This ensures the pilot completely understands they are **NOT** to enter the active runway

    In addition, please ensure you have coordinate with the TWR you have an aircraft at B2 waiting to cross the active so they can plan ahead when they can fit it in the runway crossing between departing and arriving traffic

## 3.4 Arrival Taxi Procedures

| **Runway** | **Preferred Vacate Point** |
|:----------:|:--------------------------:|
|     30R    |             A4             |
|     12L    |             A6             |

### 3.4.1 RWY30R Arrival Configuration
Aircraft landing on RWY30R will be expected to vacate the runway at A4, TWR will not immediately hand over the aircraft to the SMC Controller to prevent aircraft holding after vacating and potentially blocking the preferential exit point further leading to the runway being obstructed. Aircraft will initially be told to taxi onto taxiway 'A' by the TWR Controller and then to contact the SMC Controller. It is vitally important that the SMC Controller ensures a stand has been allocated when the aircraft is on final approach so the TWR can see whether the inbound aircraft shall vacate the runway and turn right or left onto taxiway 'A'. 

Once the aircraft has been transferred to the SMC Controller by TWR it is then the responsibility of SMC to safely and efficently move the aircraft from the taxiway to his assigned stand taken into consideration the situation on the ground.

!!!node "Not Approved"

    Aircraft landing on RWY30R shall not vacate via A6 and/or A7

#### 3.4.1.1 RWY30R Standard Arrival Taxi Phraseology

> **Pilot:** _Bahrain Ground, QTR1002, Good Evening, with you on taxiway A_

> **SMC:** _QTR1002, Welcome to Bahrain, taxi via A, Q and Z Stand 11_

### 3.4.2 RWY12L Arrival Configuration
Aircraft landing on RWY12L will be expected to vacate the runway at A6, TWR will not immediately hand over the aircraft to the SMC Controller to prevent aircraft holding after vacating and potentially blocking the preferential exit point further leading to the runway being obstructed. Aircraft will initially be told to taxi onto taxiway 'A' by the TWR Controller and then to contact the SMC Controller. It is vitally important that the SMC Controller ensures a stand has been allocated when the aircraft is on final approach so the TWR can see whether the inbound aircraft shall vacate the runway and turn right or left onto taxiway 'A'. 

Once the aircraft has been transferred to the SMC Controller by TWR it is then the responsibility of SMC to safely and efficently move the aircraft from the taxiway to his assigned stand taken into consideration the situation on the ground.

!!!node "Not Approved"

    Aircraft landing on RWY12R shall not vacate via A4

#### 3.4.2.1 RWY12L Standard Arrival Taxi Phraseology

> **Pilot:** _Bahrain Ground, Good Evening, QTR1002 with you on taxiway A_

> **SMC:** _QTR1002, Welcome to Bahrain, taxi via A, U and Z Stand 24_

### 3.5 Low Visibility Procedures (LVPs)
At Bahrain International Airport RWY12L and RWY30R are approved for CAT II operations in the event of LVPs. 

Low Visibility Procedures will be declared when the RVR reading 1000m or less, or whenever conditions are such that all the maneuvering area is not visible from the control tower.

#### 3.5.1 Low Visibility Procedures - Departures
During LVPs, intersection departures are not authorised for both RWY12L or RWY30R. 

#### 3.5.2 Low Visibility Procedures - Arrivals 
During LVPs, aircraft arriving on RWY12L may only exit the RWY to the South of taxiway A5 or beyond or arriving aircraft may exit to the North at taxiway B1 or taxiway B2.
