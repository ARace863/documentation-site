# 3. Runway Configurations

## 3.1 General
The hierachy of responsibility for determining the runway configuration is outlined as follows:

- TWR
- APP
- ACC
- SMC
- DLV 

### 3.2 Preferential Runway Configuration
At **Bahrain International Airport (OBBI)**, the preferential runway is 30R for departure and arrival which may be utilised with a tailwind of up to 5kts. If the tailwind component is greater than 5kts then runway 12L should be used for arrivals and departures.

!!! tip "References to Use" 
    - You can always refernece real world sources! However, this should NEVER become a reliance. 
    
    - All Controllers should bare the ability to read weather and make an assessment on what the active runway in use should be.

----------

#4. Departure Procedures
## 4.1 Standard Departure Points
Intersection Departures are approved at **Bahrain International Airport (OBBI)**. However, intersection departures should only be offered on pilot request or in the event A1 or A9 become unusable, pilots must be informed full length is no longer available and asked if they can accept departure from A8 or A2 respectively.


<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
Table 4.1.2 - Departure points
</p>

| **Runway** | **Intersection** |
|:----------:|:----------------:|
|     30R    |        A8        |
|     12L    |        A2        |

## 4.2 Line Up Clearances
The TWR Controller is responsible for issuing departing aircraft with a line up clearance when necessary, this could be due to aircraft still vacating the runway or due to Wake Turbulence Seperation required with the previous departure.

Standard Phraseology for line up clearances should be as follows:

> **TWR:** _JZR103, via A9 line up and wait RWY30R_

> **Pilot:** _Line up and wait RWY30R via A9, JZR103_

### 4.2.1 Conditional Line Up Clearances 
Conditional Line Up instructions shall be provided to departing aircraft to inform them of to an instruction on the basis a specific condition has been met, typically related to the movement of another aircraft or vehicle. 

Conditional Line Up Clearances are used to optimise traffic flow and runway utilisation, particularly when a clear, unobstructed runway is not immediately available. 

The Standard Phraseology for issuing Conditional Line Up Clearances is as follows: 

> **TWR:** _JZR103, behind the departing Gulf Air Airbus A321, via A9 line up and wait runway 30R, behind_

> **Pilot:** _Behind the departing Gulf Air Airbus A321, via A9 line up and wait runway 30R, behind, JZR103_

!!!node "Vital Importance"
    It is of vital importance that a conditional clearance is read back clearly to the TWR controller to ensure the instruction has been fully understood and to prevent any runway incursion


## 4.3 Takeoff Procedures

### 4.3.1 Takeoff Headings
Due to the very tight narrow airspace and immediate FIR boundaries in close proximity to **Bahrain International Airport (OBBI)** there are no published Standard Intrument Departures (SIDs). All departing aircraft are provided with an initial heading to fly after departure which directs them into the **Bahrain Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA)** so they can be sequenced and flowed correctly into the correct enroute environment or terminal environment. 

| **Runway** | **Initial Takeoff Heading** |     **Route**    |
|:----------:|:---------------------------:|:----------------:|
|     30R    |             300             |    B457 NARMI    |
|     30R    |             345             | All Other Routes |
|     12L    |             120             |    B457 NARMI    |
|     12L    |             075             | All Other Routes |

!!!node "Exception"
    Helicopters are given heading 030 after departure from all runways on all routings.

### 4.3.2 Takeoff Phraseology 
Aircraft shall be cleared for takeoff once adequate seperation exists and the runway is unobstructed.

You can find below the standard phraseology used for takeoff clearances. 

> **Pilot:** _Bahrain Tower, GFA506, fully ready for departure runway 30R_

> **TWR:** _GFA506, after departure fly heading 345 degrees, surface wind calm, runway 30R, cleared for takeoff"_

!!!node "Departure List Management" 
    All headings will provided in the departure list, it is the responsibility of the TWR controller to ensure the correct heading has been assigned prior to giving the aircraft a takeoff clearance

### 4.3.3 IFR Handoff Procedure
IFR departures shall be handed off to the appropriate departure controller when passing an altitude of **no less than 800ft and commenced their turn onto their assigned heading**

### 4.3.4 Stopping a departure
Aircraft that have commenced their take-off roll may be instructed to stop immediately to avert a collision due to a runway incursion or any other dangerous situation.

- It must be noted though, that the instruction to stop must be given early enough such that the aircraft does not reach its decision speed. The stopping distance of the aircraft is also significant. Therefore, aerodrome controllers must be vigilant and remain aware of the location of traffic at all times.

Example:

> **Pilot:* _"FDB687, stop immediately, I say again stop immediately, runway incursion."_

- For aircraft that have been given a take-off clearance, but have not yet started the roll, they shall be instructed to hold position and the take-off clearance must be cancelled along with the reason.

> **Controller:* _"FDB687, HOLD POSITION, cancel take-off, I say again cancel take-off, aircraft entering the runway."_

### 4.3.5 Low Visibility & IMC 
At Bahrain International Airport RWY12L and RWY30R are approved for CAT II operations in the event of LVPs. 

Low Visibility Procedures (LVPs) will be declared when the RVR reading 1000m or less, or whenever conditions are such that all the maneuvering area is not visible from the control tower.
When LVPs are in force the runway shall not be used for crossings at taxiway B1 and B2. 

#### 4.3.5.1 Runway 12L Low Visibility Procedures
When Low Visibility Procedures are in force, holding point A1 is the only approved departure point. Intersection Departures are not allowed during LVPs. 

#### 4.3.5.2 Runway 30R Low Visibility Procedures
When Low Visibility Procedures are in force, holding point A9 is the only approved departure point. Intersection Departures are not allowed during LVPs. 

### 4.3.6 Separation Requirements 
Aircraft shall be separated on departure in compliance with standard IFR departure separation minima or standard wake turbulence separation. 

Please reference section XXXXX of the Bahrain Tower SOP for additional information. 

----------

## 4.4 Arrival Procedures

### 4.4.1 Preferred Exit Points
In order to ensure minimum runway occupancy time pilots are expected to vacate the active runway by the taxiways. 

| **Runway** | **Exit Points** |
|:----------:|:---------------:|
|     30R    |   A4 or before  |
|     12L    |   A7 or before  |

!!!node "Note"
    - Aircraft landing on RWY30R shall not vacate the runway at A6 or A7.

    - Aircraft landing on RWY12L shall not vacate the runway at A4.

### 4.4.2 Vacating Traffic
Traffic vacating the active runway shall not be immediately transfered to the SMC Controller, it is the responsibility of the TWR Controller to issue an initial taxi clearance onto taxiway A to ensure the runway is not obstructed by aircraft stopping at the holding point and then waiting for an instruction from the SMC controller. 

The aim is to ensure the runway is kept clear to allow smooth and efficent flow of traffic in and out of **Bahrain International Airport (OBBI)**. 

The SMC Controller (if online) has the responsibility to ensure all aircraft on final approach are allocated with a stand number, this allows the TWR Controller to be able to issue an initial taxi clearance after vacating the runway in the direction of that allocated parking stand. 

#### 4.4.2.1 After Landing Phraseology 

> **TWR:** _"GFA179, Welcome to Bahrain, turn right on taxiway A hold short of taxiway R and contact Bahrain Ground on 121.850"_

> **Pilot:** _"Turn right on taxiway A, hold short of R and contacting ground on 121.850"_

### 4.4.3 Separation Requirements 

#### 4.4.3.1 General 
While the radar controllers are responsible for separating arriving aircraft, the TWR controller shall still ensure that minimum separation is maintained until the preceding aircraft crosses the runway threshold.

#### 4.4.3.2 Speed Control 
TWR Controller may use a tactical reduction in aircraft speed to ensure minimum separation between aircraft on final approach. 

> **TWR:** _GFA144, reduce to minimum approach speed_

#### 4.4.3.3 Longitudinal Separation on Final Approach 
The Longitudinal Separation between aircraft established on the final approach runway 30R/12L is reduced to 3nm. 

### 4.4.4 Go Around Procedure
At any time should a runway become unsuitable for an aircraft landing, or longitudinal separation is not met an aircraft shall be instructed to go-around. 

> **TWR:** _GFA526, "go around, I say again, go around, acknowledge"_

Once the aircraft has acknowledged the go around, the TWR Controller shall issue the aircraft which the standard missed approach phraseology. 

> **TWR:** _"GFA526, fly the standard missed approach procedure, climb altitude 2500ft, contact Bahrain Approach on 127.850"_

!!!node "Differences"
    A go-around occurs when an aircraft aborts its landing during the final approach phase after reaching the minimum descent altitude. In contrast, a "cancel approach" instruction is given when the aircraft is still in the early stages of the approach. The key difference is that during a cancel approach, air traffic control provides all the missed approach procedures in a single transmission since there is no immediate urgency. On the other hand, during a go-around, the controller instructs the aircraft to initiate the climb, and further instructions are provided once the aircraft is in the climb phase.

## 4.5 VFR Procedures

### 4.5.1 VFR Operations 

- VFR Flights taking place within the **Bahrain Control Zone (CTR)** are only permitted between the hours of sunrise and sunset. 
- VFR Flights shall not take place above FL150 to prevent entering the Class A Airspace. 
- VFR Flights are not permitted when the ceiling is less than 1500ft or when the ground visibility is less than 5KM. 
- **Bahrain Tower (TWR)** and **Bahrain Approach (APP)** both hold the authority to refuse VFR flights into either **Class D Control Zone** or the **Class C Terminal Manevuering Area** if traffic levels permit.

### 4.5.2 Visual Reporting Points (VRPs)
**Visual Reporting Points (VRPs)** are specific geographical locations used in aviation to assist pilots in navigation and communication with air traffic control. These points help pilots maintain situational awareness and provide reference points for reporting their position during flight. 

VRPs are typically marked by prominent landmarks, such as buildings, intersections, or natural features, making them easily identifiable from the air. They are particularly useful in busy airspace, allowing pilots to report their locations accurately, which helps air traffic controllers manage traffic effectively and ensure safety.

| **Identifier** |  **Name**  | **Radial & DME from BHR VOR/DME** |     **Coordinates**    |
|:--------------:|:----------:|:---------------------------------:|:----------------------:|
|       N1       | November 1 |         020 Degrees / 6nm         | 262059.85N  504157.35E |
|       N2       | November 2 |         350 Degrees / 2nm         |  261729.13N 503902.73E |
|        E       |    Echo    |         160 Degrees / 6nm         |  260945.38N 504116.75E |
|       S1       |  Sierra 1  |         230 Degrees / 4nm         |  261304.73N 503546.62E |
|       S2       |  Sierra 2  |        270 Degrees / 1.5nm        |  261533.39N 503738.75E |
|        W       |   Whiskey  |        270 Degrees / 7.5nm        |  261553.19N 503059.68E |

Aircraft Transitting the **Bahrain Control Zone (CTR)** have a mandatory reporting point overhead the BHR VOR/DME. 

### 4.5.3 VFR Departures
VFR Flights planning to depart **Bahrain International Airport (OBBI)** to leave the **Control Zone (CTR)** must first have prior approval from the APP Controller to enter the **Terminal Manevuering Area (TMA)**.
All VFR departures leaving the **Control Zone (CTR)** must exit via one of the established **Visual Reporting Points (VRPs)** described in Section 4.5.2.

#### 4.5.3.1 VFR Departure Phraseology 

> **Pilot:** _"Bahrain Tower, A9C-ZZ with you holding point A8, runway 30R"_

> **TWR:** _"A9C-ZZ, via A8, cleared for takeoff runway 30R, winds calm, report overhead Whiskey"_

> **Pilot:** _"Bahrain Tower, via A8 cleared for takeoff runway 30R, will report ovehead Whiskey VRP"_

> **Pilot:** _"Bahrain Tower, A9C-ZZ overhead Whiskey VRP"_ 

> **TWR:** _"A-ZZ, roger, contact Bahrain Approach 127.850"_ 

!!!node "Callsign Shortening"
    With VFR Traffic you are allowed to abbreviate the callsign once contact has been established. Your first transmission with the aircraft must always include their full callsign however, from then on, you may abbreviate the callsign to 3 letters, this helps reduce frequency congestion.

#### 4.5.3.2 VFR Zone Entry Phraseology 

> **Pilot:** _"Bahrain Tower, A9C-ZZ with you 5nm North West of the Whiskey VRP, Altitude 1500ft, request clearance into the Control Zone for Full Stop Landing"_

> **TWR:** _"A9C-ZZ, Good Afternoon, cleared to enter the Control Zone, not above altitude 1500ft via Whiskey VRP, QNH 1001, Squawk 7001"_

> **Pilot:** _"Cleared to enter the Control Zone not above altitude 1500ft via Whiskey VRP, QNH 1001, Squawk 7001"_ 

> **TWR:** _"A-ZZ, Readback Correct, report overhead the airfield"_

!!!node "Controller Preference"
    The Controller can elect where to have the inbound VFR traffic head to after they have recieved their initial zone entry clearance depending on traffic levels.

#### 4.5.3.3 VFR Circuits

> **Pilot:** _"Bahrain Tower, A9C-ZZ, with you holding point A8, ready for departure"_ 

> **TWR:** _"A9C-ZZ, after departure right hand turn out, via A8, cleared for takeoff RWY30R, winds calm"_

> **Pilot:** _"After departure right hand turn out, via A8, cleared for takeoff RWY30R, A9C-ZZ"_

Once the aircraft is airborne and established on the right hand turn off you can advise them to report downwind with intentions. 

> **TWR:** _"A-ZZ, report downwind with intentions"_

> **Pilot:** _"Wilco, A-ZZ"_ 

> **Pilot:** _"A-ZZ, right hand downwind RWY30R for touch and go"_

> **TWR:** _"A-ZZ, roger, you are number 2 to a Gulf Air Airbus A320 on 3nm final, maintain visual separation, caution wake turbulence, report final runway 30R"_

> **Pilot:** _"traffic is in sight, maintaining visual separation, will report final runway 30R, A-ZZ"_

> **Pilot:** _"A-ZZ, final runway 30R"_ 

> **TWR:** _"A-ZZ, cleared touch and go runway 30R, winds calm, report downwind"_

#### 4.5.3.4 VFR Service Requirements 
Within the **Class D Bahrain Control Zone (CTR)** the TWR controller is not required to provide VFR traffic with separation, the only service provided to VFR traffic is Traffic Information between VFR and IFR aircraft. 
The pilot can request traffic avoidance on request, however it is up to TWR controller as to whether they can provide.
