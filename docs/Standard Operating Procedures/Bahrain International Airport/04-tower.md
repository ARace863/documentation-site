    This section details all the necessary and required Standard Operating Procedures for Tower Operations at **Bahrain International Airport (OBBI)**

# 4. Bahrain Tower
Tower Controller (OBBI_TWR) is responsible for all aerodrome movements on runways and their associated taxiways. TWR shall also ensure separation in the control zone between IFR and IFR traffic is maintained. Traffic information shall also be provided so pilots of VFR traffic can maintain visual separation.


# 4.1 Airspace 
**Bahrain International Airport** CTR (Control Zone) is a Class Delta airspace from SFC to 2500ft.

# 4.2.1 Area of Responsibility 
Bahrain has only one Tower position (**OBBI_TWR**) and is responsibile for all Aerodrome movemements. Refer to the figure below to view the designated Area of Responsibility.

### 4.2.4 Preferential Runway Configuration
In Bahrain International Airport, the preferential runway is 30R for departure and arrival. 30s operation is preferred up to a tailwind component of 5kts. Else, 12L configuration should be applied. 


!!! tip "References to Use"
    - Utilise flightradar as a reference to judge what runways to use based on real life configuration. 
    - Always view NOTAMs to simulate different runway configurations (when required) e.g SRO. 


#4.3 Departure Procedures
### 4.3.1 Standard Departure Points

Bahrain features intersections that are allowed as departure points. However, intersection departure points that shall only be assigned after confirmation by the pilot that aircraft performance is sufficient. 


<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
Table 4.3.2. - Departure points
</p>

 |       **Runway**       |     **Departure point**     |
|:------------------------:|:-----------------------:|
|        30R       |        A5, A8, A7, A5, B1.       |
|        12L      |        A3, A2, A1, B1.       |

#4.3.3 Take-off/Landing Clearances 

### 4.3.4 Takeoff Headings 

!!!node "Do note."
    - At Bahrain, there are no SIDs. Therefore, on departure, all aircraft should be given a radar vector. 


| Takeoff Headings | Runway  | Aircraft Type    | Route             |
|------------------|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| 300              | 30R     | All              | B457 NARMI        |
| 345              | 30R     | All              | All other routes  |
| 120              | 12L     | All              | B457 TULUB        |
| 075              | 12L     | All              | All other routes  |
| 030              | 12L/30R | Helicopter/Prop  | ----------------- |

### 4.3.5 Takeoff Phraseology 

> Pilot: "GFA506 fully ready for departure runway 30R."

> Controller: **"GFA506, after departure fly heading 345, surface wind (calm) runway 30R cleared for takeoff.**

- In your takeoff clearance, you must ensure all departure headings are given based on their given route which you can find in the departure list 'T/O HDG' section. 

### 4.3.6. IFR handoff procedure
IFR departures shall be handed off to the appropriate departure controller when passing an altitude of **800ft.**

### 4.3.7 **Stopping a departure**
Aircraft that have commenced their take-off roll may be instructed to stop immediately to avert a collision due to a runway incursion or any other dangerous situation.

- It must be noted though, that the instruction to stop must be given early enough such that the aircraft does not reach its decision speed. The stopping distance of the aircraft is also significant. Therefore, aerodrome controllers must be vigilant and remain aware of the location of traffic at all times as well as runway incursion hotspots.

Example:

> Pilot: "FDB687, stop immediately, I say again stop immediately, runway incursion."

- For aircraft that have been given a take-off clearance, but have not yet started the roll, they shall be instructed to hold position and the take-off clearance must be cancelled along with the reason.

> Controller: "FDB687, HOLD POSITION, cancel take-off, I say again cancel take-off, aircraft entering the runway."


### 4.3.8 Landing Phraseology 

 >Pilot: "UAE30Y 10 miles out runway 30R, established ILS 30R."

 - Pilot has reported 10 miles away from the localiser, (10DME). You must ensure the runway is unoccupied by any other traffic prior to giving a landing clearance. 

> Controller: **"UAE30Y, surface winds (calm) runway 30R cleared to land.**

# 4.4 Seperation Requirements 
###4.4.1 General 
At Bahrain, the Tower Controller is responsible to ensure adequate seperation is maintained for both Departures and Arrivals. 

###4.4.2 Take-off Seperation Requirements
> - All departures in Bahrain are seperated every **two minutes** irrespective of their aircraft type.
> - ICAO Seperation (in terms of wake turbulence) must enforced in Bahrain at all times. 

###4.4.3 Speed Control
A Tower controller may be able to seperate traffic on the localiser through utilising tactical speed control. Refer to the example below to note down the phraseology. As a reminder, ICAO seperation should be enforced. To reference, search the ICAO seperation minima chart. 

!!!tip "When can you utilise proper speed control?"
    - To ensure the preceeding aircraft vacates the runway in time and to remove unnecesary pressure, you may ask the pilot to reduce to final approach speed. 
    - By instructing pilots to reduce to their final approach speed, this should increase the seperation on the localiser. 

> **Controller**: "GFA510 Bahrain Tower, continue approach runway 30R, reduce to final approach speed. 

!!!do "Do Note"
    Bahrain Approach/Radar may place speed restrictions to ensure seperation in the TMA prior to entering the localiser. Once traffic has been transferred to you, it is **your responsibility** to maintain the seperation until the traffic passes the runway threshold. 

###4.4.4 Go around procedure
- A go around may be issued/conducted by the Tower Controller or Pilot. As a Tower Controller, if at any time seperation is lost and the landing is unsuitable based on the aforementioned criteria, it is your responsibility to issue a missed approach. 
- The go around **must** be coordinated with the TMA controller with a reasoning. 

> **Controller:** Go around, I say again, go around acknowledge.

> **Pilot:** Go around. 

> **Controller:** Fly runway heading, climb altitude 2500ft. Contact Bahrain Approach 127.850. 

 Go arounds should be avoided at all times, however, you hold the responsibility to make correct decisions.
