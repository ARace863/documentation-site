!!!node "Covering"
    This section details all the necessary and required Standard Operating Procedures for Tower Operations at **Bahrain International Airport (OBBI)**

# 4. Bahrain Tower
Tower Controller (OBBI_TWR) is responsible for all aerodrome movements on runways and their associated taxiways. TWR shall also ensure separation in the control zone between IFR and IFR traffic is maintained. Traffic information shall also be provided so pilots of VFR traffic can maintain visual separation.


# 4.1 Airspace 
**Bahrain International Airport** CTR (Control Zone) is a Class Delta airspace from SFC to 2500ft.

# 4.2.1 Area of Responsibility 
Bahrain has only one Tower position (**OBBI_TWR**) and is responsibile for all Aerodrome movemements. Refer to the figure below to view the designated Area of Responsibility.

### 4.2.2 Preferential Runway Configuration
In Bahrain International Airport, the preferential runway is 30R for departure and arrival. In conditions of slack winds, 30s operation is preferred up to a tailwind component of 5kts. Else, 12L configuration should be applied. 


!!! tip "References to Use"
    - Utilise flightradar as a reference to judge what runways to use based on real life configuration. 
    - Always view NOTAMs to simulate different runway configurations (when required) e.g SRO. 


#4.3 Departure Procedures
### 4.3.1 Standard Departure Points

Bahrain features intersections that are allowed as departure points. However, intersection departure points that shall only be assigned after confirmation by the pilot that aircraft performance is sufficient. 


<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
Table 4.3.2. - Departure points
</p>

 |       **Runway**       |     **Departure point**     |
|:------------------------:|:-----------------------:|
|        30R       |        A5, A8, A7, A5, B1.       |
|        12L      |        A3, A2, A1, B1.       |

#4.3.3 Take-off Clearances 
- One of the main responsibilities of a Tower Controller is to issue proper takeoff clearances. 
- Take offs shall be separated on departure in compliance with standard IFR departure separation minima.
- Succeeding aircraft with the same Bahrain FIR exit point shall be separated by a minimum of two minutes.

### 4.3.4 Takeoff Headings 

!!!node "Do note."
    - At Bahrain, there are no SIDs. Therefore, on departure, all aircraft should be given a radar vector. 


| Takeoff Headings | Runway  | Aircraft Type    | Route             |
|------------------|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| 300              | 30R     | All              | B457 NARMI        |
| 345              | 30R     | All              | All other routes  |
| 120              | 12L     | All              | B457 TULUB        |
| 075              | 12L     | All              | All other routes  |
| 030              | 12L/30R | Helicopter/Prop  | ----------------- |

### 4.3.5 Takeoff Phraseology 

> Pilot: "GFA506 fully ready for departure runway 30R."

> Controller: **"GFA506, after departure fly heading 345, surface wind (calm) runway 30R cleared for takeoff.**

- In your takeoff clearance, you must ensure all departure headings are given based on their given route which you can find in the departure list 'T/O HDG' section. 

### 4.3.6. IFR handoff procedure
IFR departures shall be handed off to the appropriate departure controller when passing an altitude of **800ft**

### 4.3.7 **Stopping a departure**
Aircraft that have commenced their take-off roll may be instructed to stop immediately to avert a collision due to a runway incursion or any other dangerous situation.

- It must be noted though, that the instruction to stop must be given early enough such that the aircraft does not reach its decision speed. The stopping distance of the aircraft is also significant. Therefore, aerodrome controllers must be vigilant and remain aware of the location of traffic at all times as well as runway incursion hotspots.

Example:

> Pilot: "FDB687, stop immediately, I say again stop immediately, runway incursion."

- For aircraft that have been given a take-off clearance, but have not yet started the roll, they shall be instructed to hold position and the take-off clearance must be cancelled along with the reason.

> Controller: "FDB687, HOLD POSITION, cancel take-off, I say again cancel take-off, aircraft entering the runway."
